## :scroll:Summary ##

This was a project made by me for the end of my first programming class done in Python 3.
The goal of the project was to put in practice everything we learned, from basic programming logic
to writing, editing and reading informations in files.

This project has some basic documentation of the functions used in it, and the entire code was 
written using the PEP8 style guideline. Also, the project has a basic implementation of CRUD,
:closed_lock_with_key:criptography and a BubbleSort algorithim for ordenation.

This project was evaluated by a monitor in the second semester of 2018 and had a 10/10 score. I'm very proud of it,
as it took a lot of :muscle:work at the time
